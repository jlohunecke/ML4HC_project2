# ML4HC_project1

To run the notebooks (`proj2_pt1.ipynb` and `proj2_pt2.ipynb`), you must first

1. Create a Python environment (version 3.12.2):

```
python3.12 -m venv ml4hc_p2
```

2. Activate your environment

```
source ml4hc_p2/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The notebooks should then guide you sequentially through the code for each part of the project. Make sure to have the data available at the locations specified by the paths in the notebooks.
